# Classification-Algorithms-Python-

• To implement three classification algorithms namely K nearest neighbours, naive bayes and decision   trees.

• To implement Random forests and boosting on the implementation of decision trees.

• To use 10-fold cross validation to evaluate the performance of the classification algorithms in terms of accuracy,
  precision, recall and F1-measure.
