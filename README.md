# Classification-Algorithms-Python-

• Performed classification on biomedical datasets using K-nearest neighbours, Naive Bayes and Decision Trees.

• Also implemented random forests and boosting (using Adaboost) to improve the accuracy of the decision tree model.

• Adopted 10-fold cross validation to evaluate the performance of all the methods in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F-1 measure.
